**********************************************
let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}
***************************************************
1)What should the above code console.log?
ans: it will print keep it up 
2)Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?
ans: we cant specify isLearning === true because the value in isLearning is true
ii)if(isLearning) will work on its own because the if accepts a boolean value(true or false) and isLearning is true 

**********************************************
let firstvariable;
let secondvariable = "";
let thirdvariable = 1;
let secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstvariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstvariable || secondvariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstvariable || thirdvariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}
*********************************************
3) What should the above code console.log? Why?
ans:undefined becaue the firstvariable was created but not initialized
What is the value of firstvariable when it is initialized?
ans:first
Is the value of firstvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
ans:the value of the firstvariable is not a truthy value because it is undefined.

Is the value of secondvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
ans : the secondvariable is a falsey value because the value is considered false when  encountered in a boolean context

Is the value of thirdvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
ans:yes, because a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context

i)
if(Math.random() > 0.5){
    console.log('greater than 0.5')}
    else{
        console.log('less than 0.5)
    }
ii)A falsy (sometimes written falsey) value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. exsmples include false,0 ,null,undefined,0n ,""  etc
